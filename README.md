## Introduction
This project aims to enhance the performance and accuracy of a robotic arm using optimization techniques implemented in MATLAB. The project involves data generation, model training, and optimization of the arm's movements.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB (R2019b or later recommended)
- Basic understanding of MATLAB programming

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saiyam-jain0/Robotic-Arm-Optimization.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

    cd Robotic-Arm-Optimization

Usage

    Open MATLAB.
    Navigate to the project directory.
    Run the scripts in the following order to generate data, train models, and optimize the robotic arm:
        Generate Data:

        matlab

GenerateData2R

This script generates the necessary data for training the models.
Train ANFIS Model:

matlab

TrainANFIS_2R

This script trains an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model on the generated data.
Train MLP Model:

matlab

TrainMLP_2R

This script trains a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model on the generated data.
Optimize Robotic Arm:

matlab

        OME_Code

        This is the main optimization code for the robotic arm using the trained models.

File Descriptions

    GenerateData2R.m: Script to generate data for the robotic arm.
    TrainANFIS_2R.m: Script to train an ANFIS model.
    TrainMLP_2R.m: Script to train an MLP model.
    OME_Code.m: Main optimization code for the robotic arm.
    README.md: Project documentation.

Results

The results of the optimization process will be displayed in the MATLAB console and can be visualized using MATLAB's plotting functions. The optimized parameters will improve the efficiency and accuracy of the robotic arm.
