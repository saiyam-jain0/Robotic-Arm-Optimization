## 🚀 Objective
Harness the power of forward kinematics and optimization algorithms to precisely control a 2-link robotic arm, ensuring the end-effector reaches a specified target position with exceptional accuracy.

## 🛠️ Key Features
### 🎯 Forward Kinematics Implementation
- **Mathematical Modeling:** Define the equations for a 2-link robotic arm, calculating the end-effector's position (`fk_x`, `fk_y`) based on joint angles (`theta1`, `theta2`) and link lengths (`L1`, `L2`).

### 🧮 Cost Function Design
- **Squared Error Minimization:** Formulate a cost function that represents the squared error between the calculated end-effector position and the desired target position.

### 🔄 Optimization Algorithm
- **Cauchy Steepest Descent Method:** Implement an iterative approach to adjust joint angles, minimizing the cost function and achieving convergence to the target position.
- **Numerical Gradient Approximation:** Utilize precise gradient approximation to update joint angles in each iteration.

### 🧩 Convergence Criteria
- **Robust Convergence:** Set a convergence tolerance and a maximum number of iterations to ensure the algorithm stops when optimal joint angles are found or when iterations exceed the limit.

### 🎮 User Input Handling
- **Interactive System:** Allow user input for desired target positions, making the system adaptable and user-friendly.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **MATLAB:** For mathematical computations, algorithm development, and simulation.
- **Gradient Descent Optimization:** Advanced techniques for optimization.

## 📊 Results
Achieved successful convergence in optimizing the joint angles for the robotic arm, ensuring it precisely reaches the desired target position. The final end-effector position and optimized joint angles are displayed upon completion.
